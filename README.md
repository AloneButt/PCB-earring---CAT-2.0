# 🐱 Kitty Blinky Earrings

This project is a **pair of kitty-shaped PCBs** designed as earrings for my beloved wife 💖.  
Each earring is powered by a CR2032 coin cell and blinks two LEDs in an alternating pattern (classic astable multivibrator style 🟡🟢).  

It’s a mix of **electronics + wearable art**, made as a gift 💝.

## ✨ Features
- Kitty-shaped PCB outline 😺
- Two LEDs blinking one after another (0.5 Hz)
- Powered by a CR2032 battery (≈220 mAh)
- Minimal BOM (two transistors, resistors, capacitors, LEDs, battery holder)
- Works as earrings or just a tiny blinking desk buddy

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
- Simple transistor astable multivibrator  
- No microcontroller, no 555 timer, just pure retro discrete-component charm  
- Each side alternately lights an LED, making the kitty “sparkle”

---

## 🎁 Why?
Because sometimes the best gifts are the ones you solder yourself ❤️
